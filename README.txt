try to meet your quota at the Mango Milk Boba Shack without dodgey business practices, 
or give in and resell trashed products from the bin. This is an upbeat colourful take
on the apathy inherent in capitalist hierarchy and the tight margins created by
wars, pandemics and mismanagment.

one dodgey ingredient is expected, but with two there is no chance for a tip, with three
you arent getting paid. collect trashed products with every sale.

I composed a monotonous, upbeat tune to slowly drive you crazy. An exxageration of 
the dull repeated songs often played in large stores with restrictions on what can 
be played. I also downloaded some shop ambience from the internet and recorded sloshing, 
pouring and placing sounds for all the ingredients with a plastic cup and Audacity to clean
up the recordings.

a rage bar indicates how bad the drink is, if there are two bad ingredients an exclamation mark
appears to draw attention to the loss of tip or the whole sale, a bar below the out button
indicates how complete the drink is to draw attention to a missing boba or such,
exclamation marks appear next to the 0 in stored ingredients if the player tries to use an
ingredient but there is none left, otherwise it works.

I experimented with audio responses from the customer pitched up however these would
interrupt the game too much so I made them sounds of disgust instead however even text
responses were too distracting to keep the game fun.

All the pixel art is my own.
