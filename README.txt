A game that subverts established game mechanics (of food making games) and also
explores a theme (retail pressure and monotony):
Try to meet your quota at the Mango Milk Boba Shack without dodgey business practices, 
or give in and resell trashed products from the bin. This is an upbeat colourful take
on the apathy inherent in capitalist hierarchy and the tight margins created by
wars, pandemics and mismanagment.

description:
you start with ten dollars and must make 25 before the time is up, doing this only with fresh 
ingredients is very challanging so you are incentivised to use old ingredients as soon as you get
them from succesful orders (taken from the bin). One bad ingredient out of five may save you 
$1.00-$1.40 but two or three will have you forgoe your tip and/or pay as the customer will
refuse to pay.
A rage bar indicates how bad the drink is, if there are two bad ingredients an exclamation mark
appears to draw attention to the loss of tip or the whole sale. A bar below the out button
indicates how complete the drink is to draw attention to a missing boba or milk. An exclamation 
marks appear next to the 0 in stored ingredients if the player tries to use a bad
ingredient but there are none left.
I created the pixel art in Aseprite to appear warm but gross similar to the fake wood and peeling
posters boba places in shopping malls use.
The quantities paid, docked, costed and tipped are carefully balanced after many iterations to make
deciding what the next optimal move is to be as complex as possible.

inspiration:
The mango milk (without the boba) is based on a carton from another game I am yet to release
but have been working on, it is based on the ultra clean art styles of Google and Meta but with
pieces of copy and paisted human elements (especially evident in the screens).
I never worked in retail but my friend does so elements of the monotony are inspired 
by conversations we have had. The store music was created using BeepBox and edited in Audacity.
I was also inspired by an old game Papa's Pizzeria and Penguin Diner: Restaurant Dash, two basic
food making games that I used to enjoy where food quality is paramount, looking only at the maths
required to formulate the optimal game, this game is more advanced, only shorter.

Audio:
I composed a monotonous, upbeat tune to slowly drive you crazy. An exxageration of 
the dull repeated songs often played in large stores with restrictions on what can 
be played. I also downloaded some shop ambience from the internet and recorded sloshing, 
pouring and placing sounds for all the ingredients with a plastic cup and Audacity to clean
up the recordings.
I experimented with audio responses from the customer pitched up however these would
interrupt the game too much so I made them sounds of disgust instead however even text
responses were too distracting to keep the game fun, instead the button press sound I 
created is pitched up and distorted unpleasantly if the out button is pressed and the 
customer is angry and refusing to pay.

initial failures: customer responses diddn't fit the game and were scrapped, the original cursor was too
high resolution and looked bad on some screens, the original lose and win screens were click anywhere
to play and so often players would accidnetally start a new game when the time ran out so I added a
play button, the original goal was $30 which was hard for me and very hard for others. Technical issues
were mostly syntax but also lots of issues with the order of code and getting the resets for the out
button and starting a new game created lots of issues (compilaton issues due to logic or syntax).
Originally it was hard to tell that for a new player that the numbers corresponded to old ingredients
so I added animated notificatione exclamation marks, It was hard to tell two boba needed to be in the cup
if the milk was already poured so I added a progress bar under the out button which would only light up 
when the drink was complete.
